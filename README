Unpack is a wrap for set of unpacking tools such as tar, unrar, unzip.

The main purpose of this script is to prevent user from agression of
enemy archives which doesn't contains nested subdirectory and so
throws many different items (files and/or directories) into current
directory while unpacking. Which may be pretty paynfull if archive was
unpacked in some ~/Downloads path which already contains many
different files - new ones can easily be lost amongst old ones.

In case if archive contains only one file or one directory, it will be
extracted directly into target (current by default) dir. Otherwise, a
folder named with the archive basename (without extension) would be
created in the target directory were all archive containings would be
placed.

Archive type is deduced from archive extension.


USAGE

unpack [OPTION]... ARCHIVE

Options:
  -h         show help
  -v         show all processing info during unpacking
  -s         print result file or directory path
  --version  print script version


EXAMPLES

unpack -s test.tar.gz
unpack test.rar target-dir


HINTS

Good idea will be set some alias for fast using of this script like

alias up='unpack -s'

in the ~/.bashrc which will make 'up' to silently unpack specified
archive and print unpacked file or directory where archive contents
were placed.
