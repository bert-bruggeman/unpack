* make support for not packerd data (just archived) like *.bz2, *.gz, *.xz, *.lzo
* use MIME in case no extension is present (e.g. filename without dots at all)
* if needed directory/name is already presend - unpack as '<name> (1)'
  or something like this (must be regulated through options)
* by default unpack must show result result path (like now with -s)
